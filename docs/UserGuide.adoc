== Introduction

PrisonBook is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their prison and accessing the database of prisoners*. More importantly, PrisonBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PrisonBook can help you manage your prison faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `prisonbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your PrisonBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. Do NOT use command prompt to open the app.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all prisoners and guards
* **`add`** `n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to PrisonBook.
* **`delete`** `3` : deletes the 3rd person shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* For security reasons, users need to log in before having access to certain commands and will only see an empty PrisonBook. Users have a `Security Level` assigned to them. All commands have a minimum `Security Level` required before the user is able to access it.
** Security Level 0: Most basic commands such as Login and Status.
** Security Level 1: Most commands that only require read access.
** Security Level 2: Most commands that require write access.
** Security Level 3: Complete access to all commands.
* The minimum `Security Level` to access each command is listed beside each command below in square brackets [].

*A*: You cannot do it directly as we want to prevent users from accidentally changing these things.
Let us know what you want and we will adjust it for you according to your custom specifications.
