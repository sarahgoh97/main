== PROJECT: PrisonBook

---

== Overview

Prisonbook is a desktop address book application used for Prison Guards/Inmates management.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Allowing users to manage the prison cells.
** What it does: There is a cell map that has a fixed size and certain number of cells.
It allows guards and prison wardens to add prisoners to cells and to remove them.
It also allows guards and prison wardens to view a list of prisoners in a specified cell to help them do the previously mentioned features.
** Justification: This helps to keep track of prisoners and their locations and to take into consideration prisoner combinations
when adding and removing them from cells.

* *Minor enhancement*: Map of prison cells on GUI. It hides information on GUI before logging in and after logging out.
It will also show the list of persons in PrisonBook and people in the map when logged in successfully.
** Justification: This helps to boost security for the application, by preventing users who have insufficient security level to view classified information.
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/sarahgoh97.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/sarahgoh97.md[Test code]]
